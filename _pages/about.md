<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [Shanghao Innovation Institute](https://www.sii.edu.cn/), supervised by Research Scientist [Jing Shao](https://amandajshao.github.io/) in Shanghai AI Lab. I received my bachelor's degree from [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/html/zhiyuan/) （致远学院）, Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2024.
My research interests lie in AI safety, AI agents, and computer vision. I explored medical image processing during my undergraduate studies and am now focusing on AI agent safety research. Outside of research, I enjoy 🏸badminton and 🏋️fitness.
